The language is mostly inspired by B-Minor, with changes here and there.<br><br>It shares some of its codebase with <a href="https://aelobdog.github.io/colon-lang">Colon</a>, but that is purely because I was too lazy to re-implement some of the boiler-plate-ary code.<br><br>Work's in progress, so a lot of the code changes regularly, breaks regularly (I mean if we're being honest, when is it not broken xD) and since I'm still learning a lot of it could just be wrong/buggy/slow.<br><br>I'm keeping a log of the development process so if someone wants to follow the steps I'm taking, you can check that out <a href="log.html">here</a>.<br>
